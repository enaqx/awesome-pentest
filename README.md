# Awesome Penetration Testing [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge-flat2.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> A collection of awesome penetration testing and offensive cybersecurity resources.

[Penetration testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penetration_test) is the practice of launching authorized, simulated attacks against computer systems and their physical infrastructure to expose potential security weaknesses and vulnerabilities. Should you discover a vulnerability, please follow [this guidance](https://kb.cert.org/vuls/guidance/) to report it responsibly.

Your contributions and suggestions are heartily♥ welcome. (✿◕‿◕). Please check the [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details. This work is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
